This is my personal follow up of the paper: [Three Decades of Activations: A Comprehensive Survey of 400 Activation Functions for Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09092.pdf).
In my opinion a plot of all activation functions were missing in the paper. This could give some more intuition of the mentioned activation functions.
In this repo I will try to slowly implement all of them.

Contributions are welcome.
